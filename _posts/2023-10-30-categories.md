Great progresses have been made by researchers for the mutual devleopment between physically-based models (mechanism models) and Artificial intelligence (AI for short). Several typical milestones represent different genres, while reaching out the same purpose. To clarify each of them, **from personal perspectives**, groups are roughly made for better understanding of tags and categories in the following blogs.


### Scientific machine learning
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Three separate aspects of scientific benchmarking that apply in the context of ML benchmarks for science, namely, scientific ML benchmarking, application benchmarking and system benchmarking[^f1].

- Scientific ML benchmarking. This is concerned with algorithmic improvements that help reach the scientific targets specified for a given dataset. 
  + - [x] SciNet[^f2]: discvering simple physical concepts between distances and angles in the earth-moon system.
  + - [x] Physics-informed neural networks[^f3]: solve and discover low-dimension nonlinear partial differential equations.
  + Deep operator networks:
- Application benchmarking. This aspect of ML benchmarks is concerned with exploring the performance of the complete ML application.
  + hybrid models[^f4]: combineing concepts from machine learning and physically-based models, by parameterizing or replacing
  part of mechanisms with machine learning, in order to entitle ML with interpretability.
    * - [x] hybrid hydrological model[^f5]
  + causal deep learning[^f6]: 
- System benchmarking. This is concerned with investigating performance effects of the system hardware architecture on improving the scientific outcomes/targets.
