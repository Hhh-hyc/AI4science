Great progresses have been made by researchers for the mutual devleopment between physically-based models (mechanism models) and Artificial intelligence (AI for short). Several typical milestones represent different genres, while reaching out the same purpose. To clarify each of them, groups are roughly made for better understanding of tags and categories in this blog.


### Hybrid models
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Hybrid models combines concepts from machine learning and physically-based models, by parameterizing or replacing part of mechanisms with machine learning.

### Scientific machine learning
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

### Physics-informed neural networks
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

The two original intensions of PINNs are parameterizing anf solving partial diffential equations.

### Deep operator networks 
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }


### Causal deep learning
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }
