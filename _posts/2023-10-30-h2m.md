### Concepts in H2M

{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }
Parameters in hybrid models are categorized into ML parameters and physical parameters[^footnote]. Thus, hybrid modeling are grouped into parameteric (both learned) and non-parameteric (the latter parameters fixed) ones.

### H2M structure

_The end-to-end hybrid hydrological model_

### Creative points
- A physical state $s_{t-1}$ is taken into the recurrent neural network $ g_{RNN} $ for accounting memory effects.

$$ h_{t}=g_{RNN}(h_{t-1},[x_{t},s_{t-1}]) $$

- A mapping output function $g_{out}$ that links certain latent variable or coefficient $p_{t}$ in process-based models with $h_{t}$

- The process-based model $f_{pb}$ considers not only original physical constraints $s_{t}$, but also memory effects from RNN.

$$ y_{t}, s_{t}=f_{pb}(p_{t},x_{t},s_{t-1})$$

### Comparisons with others

0. H2M
    + Pros
        * hard physical constraints
        * additional insights of latent variables and coefficients
        * partial interpretability
    + Cons
        * qunatification of uncertainties
        * Generalizability needs to be investigated in certain cases

1. Regularization via loss functions (soft constriants)
    + penalizing physically inconsistent results
    + Pros
        * additional means in diagosing physical inconsistency
    + Cons
        * penalizing physically inconsistent results does not always make sense
        * lacks of hard physical constraints
        * no insights via latent variables and coefficients

2. Mass conserving neural networks (hard constraints)
    + adding inductive biase 
    + Pros
        * enhances robustness and generalizability
        * good performance in extreme events
    + Cons
        * does not outperform non-mass conserving architecture
        * limited interpretability

3. Data assimilation
    + combining simulations from process-based models and obervation for the optimal estimates of geophysical states
    + Pros
        * aim to quantify errors
    + Cons
        * remaining model errors

### Personal Opinions
- Compared to physics-constrained machine learning[^fn-nth-2], using neural networks to replace empirical parameter, it steps further in linking RNNs with latent variables (coefficients) in process-based models, which further taps the potential of AI.
- A question is why acknowledge latent variables (coefficients) activated by softplus function after LSTM layer as Evapotranspration and snow water equvilatent in multi-task layer<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8578879>, and how to figure out its effect.
