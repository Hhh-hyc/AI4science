      “Inspired from the universal approximation theorem, neural networks with a single layer could not only approximates continuous functions, but also continuous functional or operators”1

Concepts

functional: a mapping from a space of functions into a real number

operator: a mapping from a space of functions to another space of functions

Architecture

What DeepONet wants to do is to form a netw...

      SIMILAR to the former blog, the accurately learnt neural networks could also be beneficial when architectures are already known.

Data-driven discovery for inverse problems
Upon solving inverse problems, PINNs1 also gives examples in continuous and discrete equations.
In Navier-Strokes equations, the velocity $V(x,y,t)$ at x and y components, pressure fields $P(x,y,t)$ and their gradients would...

      Trained to solve supervised learning tasks, Physic-informed neural networks (PINNs) are defined for two classes of problems:
data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs).

Data-driven solution

Given a general form of PDEs $f(t,x)$, PINN could get to the solution $u(t,x)$ of this 1-dimensional non-linear equation with only small amount of training data...

      Concepts in H2M

Parameters in hybrid models are categorized into ML parameters and physical parameters1. Thus, hybrid modeling are grouped into parameteric (both learned) and non-parameteric (the latter parameters fixed) ones.

      Great progresses have been made by researchers for the mutual devleopment between physically-based models (mechanism models) and Artificial intelligence (AI for short). Several typical milestones represent different genres, while reaching out the same purpose. To clarify each of them, from personal perspectives, groups are roughly made for better understanding of tags and categories in the foll...
